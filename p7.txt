Thinking generally, we need a tool or label generator that allows ,, :
the client to define arbitrary sequences
of labels, each of which consists of a prefix
string coupled with an integer used as a sequence number.
Because the client may want different
sequences to be active simultaneously,
it makes sense to define the label generator
as an abstract type
called LabelGenerator.
To initialize a new generator,
the client provides the prefix string and the
initial index as arguments to the LabelGenerator constructor.
Once the generator has been created,
the client can return new labels in the sequence by calling nextLabel
on the LabelGenerator. As
an illustration of how the interface works,test
the main program shown here followed by the output:
